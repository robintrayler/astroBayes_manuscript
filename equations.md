# Probability of radioisotopic ages

An age model consists of a vector of stratigraphic positions ( $\overrightarrow{d}$ ) and corresponding vector of model ages ($\overrightarrow{t}$) that relate stratigraphic position to absolute time. The stratigraphic positions of the of the radioisotopic ages {$d_i ... d_n$} are subset of  $\overrightarrow{d}$ . The correspond age of $d_i$ is $t_i$, which defined by the radioisotopic ages. Since it is common to date several horizons throughout a stratigraphic section, we define the probability of an age model with components  $\overrightarrow{d}$  and $\overrightarrow{t}$ , and *n* radioisotopic ages as: 

$$\prod_{i=1}^{n}[\mathcal{P}(t_i)]$$ {#eq:radio_prob}

where $\mathcal{P}$ is is the weighted mean age of a given radioisotopic date given its mean (*μ~i~*) and variance (*σ^2^~i~*)

$$t_i = \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2_i)$$

Since the probability of the overall age model [$\overrightarrow{d}$, $\overrightarrow{t}$] depends only the positions $d_i$ and ages $t_i$, @eq:radio_prob effectively anchors the age model to the radioisotopic ages by calculating how well the age model "overlaps" the dates in absolute time.
