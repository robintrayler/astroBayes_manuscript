# Bayesian Integration of Astrochronology and Radioisotope Geochronology

This repository contains the data, code, and manuscript editing history for 

**Trayler, R. B., Meyers, S. R., Sageman, B. B., Schmitz, M. D., (in prep) *Bayesian Integration of Astrochronology and Radioisotope Geochronology***. 

The code, installation instructions, and user guide for the `{astroBayes}` `R` package can be found at [github.com/robintrayler/astroBayes](https://github.com/robintrayler/astroBayes). 

## File Structure 
The breakdown of the files and R scripts in this repository is below. If you would like to reproduce the tests in the manuscript run the scripts in the `./R/` directory *in the order listed* below. Note that the `results` directory is empty in this repository as it is too large to archive on GitHub.  

## **ðŸš¨WARNINGðŸš¨** 
These scripts are designed to be run in parallel on a fairly powerful desktop computer or cluster. **Otherwise, they will take several days or weeks to complete and will generate approximately 1 terabyte of results files**. It is not recommended to run them on a personal laptop.

## Manuscript Structure

This manuscript is written in [`Pandoc`](https://pandoc.org) flavored markdown. Follow the instructions [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) to install `Pandoc`. The manuscript also relies on the [`pandoc-crossref`](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref) filter to handle figure, table, and section numbering. 

The manuscript file, `manuscript.md` can be compiled into a nicely formatted PDF by running the following pandoc command.

```bash
pandoc -s -f markdown+mark -o manuscript.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex --filter pandoc-crossref --citeproc --number-sections manuscript.md
```
